# ElementsOfTrivia

Coded in Visual Basic .NET in Visual Studio, this game was a project that I completed as a Final Project for the Elements of Game Design class (GAME 2000) at Fitchburg State University in Fall 2014.

This is an original two player game, where the goal is to earn points by answering trivia questions. Players can either use the question set that was used when students played this game as part of Finals back in 2014, or they can create and load their own (an Excel workbook is provided to allow for players to create their own questions).
